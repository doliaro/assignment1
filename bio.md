Dominic Oliaro

Im from Santa Fe, New Mexico. I attended the University of New Mexico and obtained a biology degree. Im currently working as a Clinical Allergy Specialist. Im working on the 2 year track so I can switch professions and pursue something in programming, I like it all so Im not too picky yet. 

I spend my free time playing hockey, being with my family and occasionally some video games
