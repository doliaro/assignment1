Programming Background

My name is Dominic Oliaro and Im from Santa Fe, New Mexico. I attended the University of New Mexico and obtained a biology degree. Im currently working as a Clinical Allergy Specialist. Im working on the 2 year track so I can switch professions and pursue something in programming, I like it all so Im not too picky yet. I spend my free time playing hockey, being with my family and occasionally some video games

I really enjoyed the battleship game I built in CS161 for the final project.It was neat to bring all my knowledge together.

In CS162 I felt like I really improved upon my C++ knowledge and was really becoming more comfortable with it. I was much more proud of my work as I continued to learn. 

In some of my free time I have also studied Javascript and some of its frameworks.
